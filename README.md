# Project Setup and Execution Guide

## Getting Started

### Install Required Libraries
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the Application
This project now uses Chainlit for its user interface.

1. **Set Environment Variables**: Make sure you have your `GOOGLE_API_KEY` set in a `.env` file in the project root.

2. **Run the app**:
   ```sh
   chainlit run app.py -w
   ```
   The `-w` flag enables auto-reloading, so the app will restart when you make changes to the code.

3. **Open in your browser**: Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000`.

**Note**: The old FastAPI entry point, `main.py`, is no longer used and can be deleted.

üêõ **Debug Mode Activated!** The project has bugs waiting to be squashed - your mission is to fix them and bring it to life.

## Debugging Instructions

1. **Identify the Bug**: Carefully read the code and understand the expected behavior.
2. **Fix the Bug**: Implement the necessary changes to fix the bug.
3. **Test the Fix**: Run the project and verify that the bug is resolved.
4. **Repeat**: Continue this process until all bugs are fixed.
