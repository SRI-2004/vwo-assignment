    4.  **Synthesize Findings**: Analyze the retrieved text chunks. For each biomarker, extract the value, units, and 
        reference range. Synthesize all findings into a holistic analysis and provide clear, empathetic advice.
    5.  **Be Exhaustive with the Data**: Your goal is to be thorough with the data you retrieve from your single search,
