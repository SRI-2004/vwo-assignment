1.      TSH levels are subject to circadian variation, reaching peak levels between 2 - 4.a.m. and at a
            minimum between 6-10 pm . The variation is of the order of 50% .  hence time of the day has
                                                    influence on the measured serum TSH concentrations.
2. Alteration in concentration of Thyroid hormone binding protein can profoundly affect Total T3 and/or
                            Total T4 levels especially in pregnancy and in patients on steroid therapy.
3.    Unbound fraction ( Free,T4 /Free,T3) of thyroid hormone is biologically active form and correlate
                        more closely with clinical status of the patient than total T4/T3 concentration

                                2.         It is recommended to consider supplementary testing with plasma Methylmalonic acid (MMA) or
                                      plasma homocysteine levels to determine biochemical cobalamin deficiency in presence of clinical
                                   suspicion of deficiency but indeterminate levels. Homocysteine levels are more sensitive but MMA is
                                                                                                                         more specific
                                3.     False increase in Vitamin B12 levels may be observed in patients with intrinsic factor blocking
                                                                     antibodies, MMA measurement should be considered in such patients
                                4.               The concentration of Vitamin B12 obtained with different assay methods cannot be used
                                                           interchangeably due to differences in assay methods and reagent specificity
